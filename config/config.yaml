# List of effects to apply, in order.
# The pipeline will apply each effect sequentially in the order listed below.
#effects:
#  - name: "bandpass"     # effect type: bandpass filter (keeps only frequencies in a band)
#    low_freq: 300        # low cut frequency in Hertz (Hz) — frequencies below this attenuated
#    high_freq: 3000      # high cut frequency in Hertz (Hz) — frequencies above this attenuated
#
 # - name: "pitchshift"    # effect type: raise / lower pitch
#    semitones: 2         # pitch shift amount in semitones (positive = higher pitch, negative = lower)
#
#  - name: "mixnoise"      # effect type: overlay (mix) noise with the audio
#    volume: -20          # noise volume in decibels relative to full scale (dB). Negative values quieter.
