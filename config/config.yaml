# List of effects to apply, in order.
# The pipeline will apply each effect sequentially in the order listed below.
effects:
  - name: "bandpass"     # effect type: bandpass filter (keeps only frequencies in a band)
    low_freq: 300        # low cut frequency in Hertz (Hz) — frequencies below this attenuated
    high_freq: 3000      # high cut frequency in Hertz (Hz) — frequencies above this attenuated

  - name: "pitchshift"    # effect type: raise / lower pitch
    semitones: 2         # pitch shift amount in semitones (positive = higher pitch, negative = lower)

  - name: "mixnoise"      # effect type: overlay (mix) noise with the audio
    volume: -20          # noise volume in decibels relative to full scale (dB). Negative values quieter.
